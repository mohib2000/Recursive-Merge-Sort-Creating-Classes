# Recursive-Merge-Sort-Creating-Classes
This project efficiently sorts and manages `Person` objects using a recursive merge sort algorithm in Python. It integrates object-oriented programming with algorithmic design, focusing on custom sorting, stability, and extensibility, making it ideal for handling complex data structures in a modular way.
